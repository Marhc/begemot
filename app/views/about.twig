  <h2>How to Post</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Compose a new email to <a href="mailto:post@post.begemot.io">post@post.begemot.io</a>.</li>
    <li>Put the title of your post in the subject.</li>
    <li>Write your post in the email body.</li>
    <li>Send it!</li>
    <li>Pat yourself on the back (if flexible enough).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Our mail gnomes will process your email and create a new post in the <code>{{ user ? user['posts_path'] : '_posts' }}</code> directory of your repo.
    Github will pick up this post and put it on your blog. We'll also send you an email to confirm that we got your post.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Advanced users:</em>
    You don't have to include the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/">front matter</a>, we'll generate it for you.
    But you can include it if you want tags or other custom fields.
  </p>

    <h2>Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      I don't store your emails. I will not sell your personal information to anyone.
      Please don't use this service for anything private or illegal.
    </p>

    <h2>Money</h2>
    <p>
      I plan to keep this <strong>free</strong> forever. If this gets so popular that I can't afford the upkeep anymore, I'll think of something.
